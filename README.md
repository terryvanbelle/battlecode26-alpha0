# Battlecode 2026 Alpha0

Search-guided self-play in MIT Battlecode 2026's **official Java engine 1.2.6**. This is an initial CPU research experiment: an AlphaZero-style policy/value network, PUCT search, terminal game outcomes, replay training, and a frozen **12-bot panel**: ten external competitors from `battlecode26b-vibe`'s downloaded pool, the official example player, and that project's current accepted champion.

The current policy uses 17 turn-level macros, automatic pickup/transfer/attacks, and privileged full-state features. It is **not tournament compatible** and does not yet search the complete Battlecode action space. No strength claim follows from a small integration run.

## Measured progress

Initial run: **6 self-play games, 43,779 retained positions, 3 training iterations**. All four checkpoints completed the final 12-bot smoke panel: **96 evaluation games, no unresolved failures**. Final score is **5/24 wins (20.8%)**, matching the untrained baseline; this run does not demonstrate an overall strength improvement.

Every point comes from the committed JSONL data in `progress/`. Evaluation uses the greedy network without search because legacy Java bots contain live threads that cannot be snapshotted. Search remains active in self-play. Graphs refresh locally after each iteration and opponent; GitHub updates when those files are pushed.

## Run locally

Linux x86-64, Python 3.11+, and a JDK 21 are supported. The setup script downloads hash-pinned official engine assets and a local JDK if needed.

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
.venv/bin/python -m alpha0.train train --config configs/smoke.json --run-dir runs/initial
```

The smoke experiment is deliberately small: 49,242 parameters, four search simulations per decision, two full games and 32 gradient updates per iteration. The production starting configuration uses 103,290 parameters and 32 simulations; it has not been demonstrated to produce a strong bot.

```bash
# Continue the same run with its original configuration.
.venv/bin/python -m alpha0.train train --config configs/smoke.json --run-dir runs/initial --resume --iterations 20

# A larger, separate experiment (use a separate progress directory too).
.venv/bin/python -m alpha0.train train --config configs/train.json --run-dir runs/main --progress-dir runs/main/progress

# Evaluate a saved checkpoint against all 12 frozen bots, both seats.
.venv/bin/python -m alpha0.train evaluate runs/initial/latest.pt --suite smoke

# Rebuild the committed plots from measured logs.
.venv/bin/python scripts/plot_progress.py
```

Checkpoints, complete action histories, and bounded replay buffers live under ignored `runs/`. The first experiment's four checkpoints, six complete action transcripts and provenance are published under [`artifacts/initial`](artifacts/initial). To verify a published game transcript, run `.venv/bin/python scripts/replay_game.py artifacts/initial/games/iter-0003-game-001.json`. Do not load untrusted checkpoints. The engine and JDK downloads are excluded from Git; their URLs and hashes are recorded by the setup.

## Compute limits and portability

Learned turns bypass bytecode instrumentation. Legacy bots receive a one-billion-bytecode per-turn allowance, and the engine's cumulative team execution timeout is disabled. Java/Python retain ordinary process/host memory limits; no tournament-sized JVM heap cap is imposed. Per-request and per-game wall-clock watchdogs prevent stalled experiments from hanging indefinitely. [Exact changes and remaining limits](docs/engine.md).

Training currently runs on the attached CPU machine. **`battlecode-dev` is not being used.** Its historical configuration and the missing access prerequisites are in [compute notes](docs/compute.md). Existing VM workloads have not been changed.
